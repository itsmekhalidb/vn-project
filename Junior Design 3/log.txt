I understand your suggestion, but using a nuclear option would not be a viable solution to this particular threat. The goal is to neutralize the enemy 
and protect our citizens without causing unnecessary harm or collateral damage. We must take a measured approach that prioritizes the safety of our nation 
while also minimizing the potential impact on innocent lives. It's important to explore alternative strategies that consider all aspects of the situation.
